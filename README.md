# dotfiles

# Todo

- Debugging
- set keybinds to be silent, maybe find a plugin that lists all the recent actions performed recently (not just key presses). Will be good for stream / video. Find a better keypress / action shower
- Obsidian plugin / or pivot to some other plugin that can follow markdown links
- try and add dotnet file presets to mini-files
- Look into git plugins, something that doesnt require me to actually learn git cli
- spell check for my illiterate ass
- make or find xml documentation snippets for  ///<summary></summary> style documentation.
- figure out how to auto complete overrides


# Issues

- [roslyn decompile not working inside of already decompiled files](https://github.com/seblj/roslyn.nvim/issues/116) A workaround for me was to run `Roslyn target` every time you open it, dont let it auto target
