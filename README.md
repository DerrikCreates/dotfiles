# dotfiles

# Todo

- Debugging
- clean up key binds
- change plugin settings in the `config` function or init it using the a table, not both.
- set keybinds to be silent, maybe find a plugin that lists all the recent actions performed recently (not just key presses). Will be good for stream / video
- install a tree plugin to mirror my rider setup of always having file view on side. Or add some other view to shift the code more center.
- Obsidian plugin / or pivot to some other plugin that can follow markdown links
- try and add dotnet file presets to mini-files
- Look into git plugins, something that doesnt require me to actually learn git cli
- spell check for my illiterate ass


# Issues

- [roslyn decompile not working inside of already decompiled files](https://github.com/seblj/roslyn.nvim/issues/116) A workaround for me was to run `Roslyn target` every time you open it, dont let it auto target
- there is an issue with cycling though documentation / auto complete. Change the hotkeys to something better
- make pressing enter when hovered on an auto complete select and enter that snippet.
- figure out how to auto complete overrides
